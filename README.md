# HTNE2021

This project was created for Hack The Northeast: Beyond 2021.

DATACation provides high school students with a one-stop site to find resources for assistance in Mathematics, English,
Science, and Social Studies. Based on the users selection from a drop down menu for their grade and specified subject
they would like assistance with, the website would redirect them to new page consisting of helpful resources the student
can use.
